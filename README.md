# daily-practice
A place to put all my code for the next 180 days

1. Inspired by John Resig Post [here](https://johnresig.com/blog/write-code-every-day/)  and [Jenniferdewalt] (https://jenniferdewalt.com/)

Understanding web browser and javascript without sustained practice is an impossible task.
my level of understanding is significantly  low comparatively to other devs in the field at the current experience level.
This is my humble attempt to re-create what john resig and 


*Table Of Contents*
*JavaScript*
 * Basics 
 * Data Structures
 * DOM events
 * Functional Programming
 * Will keep updating this readme....

The idea here is to be a free form version of practice, rather than a orderly list which makes it a work rather than an enjoyment.

The Day Is One  and is the hardest.
